1. Here in this project, we have two players rolling the dice and the system will announce the winner as the one with highest number rolled on their dice.
2. I have done this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
3. There will be a button, which the user needs to press, so that the dice rolls and as per the numbers on each dice, a winner is announced.
